# MusicApp-Databse
- This repository discusses a music app database built using SQL.
- The app database is similar to any usual mobile music app where the user is allowed to:

  2. Download or like songs
  3. Listen or like podcasts
  4. Follow multiple artists
- The entity relationship diagram and schema of the whole project are also included as a draw.io file and pdfs
