# MusicApp-Databse
- This repository discusses a music app database built using SQL.
- The app database is similar to any usual mobile music app where the user is allowed to:
  1. Create multiple playlists
  2. Download or like songs
  3. Listen or like podcasts
  4. Follow multiple artists
-The main idea of the project is to create a database of a music app such as Anghami. The project is built in such a way that the downloader firstly creates an account then it is compulsory to all the created ACCOUNTS to create at least one user and the account have the right to create various USERS. The created account is allowed to subscribe a SUBSCRIPTION where the creator is asked to pay a yearly fee depending on the type of subscription made. The app has a variety of options where the user is allowed to create or watch LIVES as well as creating or listening to PODCASTS. By moving to the musical part of the app we can say that each user can create multiple PLAYLISTS that contains many SONGS. Those songs are all contained in different ALBUMS which are either created by ARTISTS or BANDS. All the users can like or download various songs as much as they want. The users are also allowed to follow various artists or bands.
- The entity relationship diagram and schema of the whole project are also included as a draw.io file and pdfs
- The SQL commands needed to build the project is also attached.
